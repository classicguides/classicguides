          <p class="mt-2">Priests are powerful healers, and can be deadly as ranged DPS, if specced properly. Priests
            were long the
            premier healers in World of Warcraft, and although other classes have been improved to match their prowess,
            priests will still generally be assumed to fill the healer role in groups. Players who do not enjoy healing
            are thus advised to consider a different class, as playing a priest guarantees that you will be healing at
            some point. Priests can specialize in the shadow tree to become extremely effective single-target ranged
            DPS casters, and at higher levels (50+) the damage they cause can return mana to their group. Priests are
            also able to cast a number of very useful buffs that any party will find useful.
          </p>

            Priests 3 talent specializations are
            <strong>Holy, Discipline, and Shadow.</strong>

            fight.

            <br> Suitable for raiding. Change to this spec once you’re more comfortable with healing and your gear is
            looking better, it should increase your overall healing output. There may be slight variations depending on
            what other priests in your raid are doing, e.g. you may or may not be required to take Improved Renew,
            Inspiration, Holy Nova etc.

          <h5 class="priest">PVP</h5>
          <p>In PVP, of course your main role is to heal. However priests once again bring a lot of utility. For
            example, dispelling polymorphs and mind controlling people off the cliff at the Lumber Mill in Arathi
            Basin.</p>
          <p>The ‘geared 60 spec’ above works just fine for PVP if you want to stand back and heal, but I prefer to use
            the below hybrid spec.</p>

            <br> This build gives you Mind Flay, Improved Psychic Scream, Silence and Improved Mana Burn—all of which
            make you more useful than a stock standard healer.

          <p>You shold reach the soft hitcap (8%) as soon as possbile. Your abilities can no longer miss at this
            point.
            <br> You should stack as much hit as possible, because most of your damage comes from white hits
            (auto attacks).
            <br> You should use a fast offhandm because Whirlwind doesn't use your offhand in Classic. It's also
            better for rage generation.</p>


          <p>I strongly recommend downloading the addon Theorycraft. This will expand the ingame tooltip of your
            spells and give detailed information about the items you’re wearing and their effect on your
            spells.

          <h3 class="priest">Consumables</h3>
          <p>Below I’ve listed some common consumables. There are others out there of course, but this should do you
            for the most part.</p>

          <h5 class="priest">Common Consumables: </h5>
          <ul>
            <li>Major Mana Potion - <strong>MUST HAVE!</strong></li>
            <li>Demonic Rune - <strong>MUST HAVE!</strong></li>
          </ul>
          <p>Major Mana Potions should be regularly available on AH for a reasonable price or you can loot them from
            the chest at the end of DM North (Tribute) runs. <br> Demonic Runes can be farmed from northern
            Felwood—make friends with a DPS who’ll help you do this or multi-box if allowed.</p>
          <p>You should stock up on these for every raid and use them early on in boss fights so that they cool down
            and you can use them again if needed. As you gain more exposure to raiding, you’ll get better at knowing
            how long fights go for and how much mana you’re going to burn.

          </p>
          <h5 class="priest">Easy-to-Obtain Consumables</h5>
          <ul>
            <li>Crystal Force (+20 Spirit)</li>
            <li>Kreeg's Stout Beatdown (+25 Spirit, -5 Intellect)</li>
            <li>Lesser Mana Oil (+8 MP5)</li>
          </ul>

          <h5 class="priest">Hard-to-Obtain Consumables (due to mats required/low availability on AH)</h5>
          <ul>
            <li>Brilliant Mana Oil (+12 MP5)</li>
            <li>Elixir of the Sages (+18 Intellect and Spirit)</li>
            <li>Flask of Distilled Wisdom (+2000 Mana)</li>
            <li>Greater Fire/Shadow/Nature/Frost Protection Potions</li>
            <li>Nightfin Soup (+9 mp5)</li>
            <li>Sagefish Delight (+6 mp5)</li>
          </ul>

          <p>Depending on your server, some of the above consumables may not stack with buffs (e.g. Crystal Force and
            Divine Spirit). Be sure to investigate before obtaining too many.</p>

          <h3 class="priest">Healing Essentials</h3>
          <br>
          <h5 class="priest">Downranking</h5>
          <p>Mastering how to downrank is key to becoming a great healer. The idea is to use lower level spells that
            cost less mana. These spells will still be effective because of the + healing from your gear.</p>

          <p>In raids downranking is mandatory as there can be up to 10 healers in the group and one or more of them
            will be casting a heal on the same target as you. Essentially, you want to heal someone just enough and
            avoid overhealing them as much as possible (which is a waste of mana).</p>

          <p>Start by experimenting with a mix of different ranked spells which heal for different amounts.</p>

          <p>I’m currently using the following:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Heal Rank 3, Greater Heal Rank 1 and Flash Heal Rank 4</strong> <br> - Used to top people off</li>
            <li><Strong>Flash Heal Rank 7:</Strong> <br> - Used in high-intensity situations to stop people from dying</li>
            <li><strong>Greater Heal 4:</strong> <br> - Used only on tanks when necessary</li>
            <li><strong>Renew and Prayer of Healing (max rank):</strong> - Used situationally</li>
          </ul>

          <p>You should keep changing this up as you become more experienced and more geared. I personally don’t like
            having too many keybinds or clicking a lot, so I’m probably sticking with max rank Renew and Prayer of
            Healing for a long time but will keep tinkering with Heal/Greater Heal/Flash Heal.</p>

          <hr>

          <h5 class="priest">Fade</h5>
          <p>Priests are lucky to have such a great threat drop. It has saved me countless times in Onyxia when there’s
            a lot of whelps chasing me or in BWL during Razorgore when there’s a loose dragon. If you’re anything like
            me (who came from healing as a druid before playing a priest), you might forget you have it, so practice
            using it as much as you can in appropriate situations.</p>

          <hr>

          <h5 class="priest">Mana Regen While Casting</h5>
          <p><strong>The ‘five second rule’</strong></p>
          <p>In the Discipline tree, there’s a talent called Meditation that allows up to “15% of mana regeneration to
            continue while casting.” Have you ever wondered what is meant by “while casting”? For a long time, I
            thought it meant while you were casting a spell. It’s actually referring to the ‘five second rule’. After
            you cast a spell, you’re considered ‘casting’ for the next five seconds and won’t regenerate any mana from
            spirit, only from mp5. Try it, cast a spell and count to five, only then will you see your mana start to
            regenerate in big ticks. Once you’re out of the casting state you will regenerate these ticks every two
            seconds.</p>

          <p>This is important to know for a couple of reasons.</p>

          <p>Firstly, in dungeons and especially in raids, you’re usually always in the ‘casting’ state during fights
            which is why it’s important to try and increase your spirit and the % of mana you regenerate while casting.
            Therefore Meditation is a non-negotiable talent and you should try to get the 3-set bonus from the t2
            priest set (Vestments of Transcendence) ASAP which will bring you to a total of 30%.</p>

          <p>Following this logic, in contrast, when shadow specced for PVE you should aim for mp5 over spirit as
            you’ll only have access to Meditation for 15% mana regeneration while casting. You won’t have the
            additional 15% from the t2 priest set (you wouldn’t wear it because it only provides + healing, not +
            damage).</p>

          <p>The second thing is that when you’re more experienced, you can coordinate spell casts with the five second
            rule in mind. For example:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>Cast Greater Heal</li>
            <li>The five second timer begins</li>
            <li>Wait three 3 seconds</li>
            <li>Start casting your second Greater Heal</li>
            <li>Five seconds pass since the first cast so you get a tick of mana back</li>
            <li>Second Greater Heal finishes casting and timer starts again</li>
            <li>Rinse and repeat for maximum mana efficiency</li>
          </ul>

          <p>This isn’t viable all the time but works in low-intensity situations. If you want to try this, I’d
            recommend downloading the TNE FiveSec addon.</p>

          <h5 class="priest">Power Word: Shield</h5>
          <p>As a general rule, in PVE Power Word: Shield should only be in used in emergencies and situationally
            depending on the fight, not as a main healing spell. Note that warriors generate most of their threat from
            damage taken (so refrain from shielding them unless necessary), whereas druids generate most of their
            threat from damage done (so it’s fine to shield them but still not recommended).</p>

          <hr>

          <h5 class="priest">Renew</h5>
          <p>Renew is great in terms of healing per second and is not worth downranking in my opinion (though I’ve
            heard it can be in much later raids like Naxx). If you want to include it as a part of your dungeon
            rotation then you can, especially on the tank. In raids, there can only be 1 Renew on a target at any time
            so unless you’re the assigned tank Renew priest (which should be the one with the highest + healing), you
            don’t need necessarily need to spend talent points on Improved Renew.</p>

          <p>Here’s a macro you can copy paste which will ensure you don’t overwrite an existing Renew:</p>
          <div class="card">
            <div class="card-body">
              <p class="card-text">/run m=0 for i=1,40 do
                if(strfind(tostring(UnitBuff(“target”,i)),”Spell_Holy_Renew”))then m=1 end end if m==0 then
                CastSpellByName(“Renew(Rank 9)”) end</p>
            </div>
          </div>

          <hr>

          <h5 class="priest">Top up the tank in between pulls</h5>
          <p>It’s important to top the tank up in between pulls. Otherwise, on the next pull you’ll need to cast a big
            heal on the tank before he’s had a chance to build threat on multiple targets which means they’ll come
            straight for you.</p>
