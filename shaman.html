          <p class="mt-2">Shamans, manipulators of the elements, are versatile like druids and paladins -- able to be
            healers,
            ranged spell DPS or melee DPS depending on their spec and gear. Until endgame instances, they are sometimes
            able to tank passably well, although they are considerably more limited in this than a druid, paladin, or
            warrior. Shamans are able to place totems that provide a huge variety of useful buffs to their group. These
            buffs are restricted to a relatively small area of effect surrounding the totem, and a shaman may have no
            more than four totems active at one time. <strong>Shamans are restricted to Horde players.</strong>

          <br>
          <h3 class="shaman">Talents</h3>
          <p>Let’s begin with a solid spec. Knowing how to allocate your talents is no longer a meme if transitioning
            from retail. I will provide you a visual and a link for what is considered the standard PvE Resto
            specialization.</p>
          <p>
            <a href="https://classicdb.ch/?talent#hZxZEcxtieqo" target="_blank">Standard Resto 0/5/46 &nearr;</a>
          </p>
          <img src="imgs/shaman-standard-resto.png" alt="Shaman" class="img-fluid">

          <p>You can tweak this spec to afford both Improved Reincarnation and full 3/3 in Healing Grace by simply
            taking as many points out of Healing Focus as you desire. However, I am not a big fan of Improved
            Reincarnation until later instances in Classic. Warlocks have the ability to Soulstone any healer with
            resurrection capabilities for wipe protection. Also there should be 4+ Shaman in your raid with whom an
            Ankh rotation can be established in the event of wipes.</p>

          <p>If you are considering avoiding points in Healing Grace in order to pick up Improved Reincarnation, I
            would heavily advise against it. Chain Heal generates a significant amount of threat, especially with full
            consumables, and –if you find yourself in a melee group– you will not be able to drop Tranquil Air Totem,
            unless specifically required, drastically increasing your risk of pulling aggro on trash or boss mobs. A
            dead Shaman is a worthless Shaman.</p>

          <p>Instead, I would take 2 talent points from Ancestral Healing. Unless your primary job in a raid is tank
            healing, you aren’t getting very much mileage out of the talent and, in that case, take the remaining point
            from Ancestral Healing and move it to Healing Grace.</p>

            <a href="https://classicdb.ch/?talent#hZxZEfxdAeqo" target="_blank">End-Game Resto 0/5/46 &nearr;</a> <br>
            The best endgame spec, arguably even better to begin with, is one utilizing Imp Reincarnation and [Totem of
            Rebirth]. An additional benefit to this spec is securing the last point in Healing Grace, aiding on trash
            healing as well as encounters with multiple adds -prevalent especially in Naxxramas. The spec is as
            follows:

        <!-- Stat Priority -->
        <div class="tab-pane fade" id="stat-priority">
          <br>
          <h3 class="shaman">Stat Priorities</h3>

          <p>Stats for Resto Shamans are very straightforward. There are: Intellect, Stamina and Spirit as primary
            stats and then: MP5, Healing Power (hSP) and Spell Crit as your secondary stats. Typically, the primary
            stats and secondary stats are prioritized in that order.</p>

          <p>Overall, the stat priority will look like this: MP5, Intellect, hSP, Stamina, Spell Crit, Spirit.</p>

          <p>Almost every item you pick up in the beginning will have some mix of Intellect and Stamina while very few
            will have Spirit. It is important to avoid picking up Spirit as much as possible in the early stages of the
            game as you will lose a considerable amount of item budget to this significantly less valuable stat. It is
            also important in the early stages to pick up as many items as you can with MP5 since it is a rare and
            integral stat for the Resto Shaman. MP5 also happens to be a unique stat in that its HEP value far
            outweighs its item budget. The EP system arose from that Chinaman, Ming (pbuh), who wanted to more
            accurately prioritize gear in very minute ways. In order to figure out which piece was the best possible
            upgrade, he created systems of EP that ranked his respective stats by personal value. This way, he could
            find items that were even slight upgrades. I rank my HEP values against MP5.</p>

          <p>**HEP Values: [stat : 1 MP5]</p>

          <ul>
            <li>Intellect: 5:1</li>
            <li>MP5: 1:1</li>
            <li>hSP: 6:1</li>
            <li>Crit: N/A</li>
          </ul>

          <p>In a perfect world (AKA not Classic, though hopefully Classic), you have a combat logging system from
            which you may calculate the overall benefit/loss of equipping certain stats over the period of hundreds to
            thousands of spell casts and spell lands. Here, I can gauge the rough benefit via checking my overall
            healing done when playing in the same style, on the same encounter, over the same duration. It is always
            hard to judge accuracy this way as the difference from one week to the next, even on the same boss, can be
            profound when human error and RNG are thrown in. I have found these numbers to be accurate in assessing
            which pieces of gear are actually worth picking up.</p>

          <h3 class="shaman">Consumables</h3>
          <p>Hands down, the most important preemptive measure to raiding a Resto Shaman can take: consumables. Hate
            them or love them, it is figuratively impossible to survive in Classic without them. Your arsenal of
            consumables will impact your performance so greatly that you may as well be playing two Shaman.

          <p>While the farming time may be rough I assure you it is a necessary evil. Take this time to familiarize
            yourself with what consumables you can consider “standard” for the average progression raid:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Flask of Distilled Wisdom x2 </li>
            <li>Flask of Distilled Wisdom x2 </li>
            <li>Brilliant Mana Oil x2 </li>
            <li>Mageblood Potion x20 </li>
            <li>Elixir of Greater Intellect x20 </li>
            <li>Sagefish Delight x20 </li>
            <li>Nightfin Soup x20 </li>
            <li>Demonic Rune / *Dark Rune x20 </li>
            <li>Elixir of the Sages x20 </li>
            <li>Rumsey Rum Black Label x20 </li>
            <li>Limited Invulnerability Potion x5 </li>
          </ul>

          <ul>
            <li>Scroll of Intellect IV</li>
            <li>Scroll of Spirit IV</li>
            <li>Scroll of Stamina IV</li>
            <li>Scroll of Protection IV</li>
            <li>Crystal Force</li>
          </ul>

          <p>The items I listed above the line should be considered compulsory raid consumables. Some are more complex
            than others to farm but most of them should be no trouble at all. **If you are an old school player and
            have noted that Songflowers, Night Dragon’s Breath etc. are not included it is because they are bugged on
            this server and do not work, it is not Classic yet, or I got drunk and forgot to update the guide.</p>

          <p>As for the items I have listed below the line, you can think of them as a little extra for progression
            encounters, or if you’re a tryhard. Again, bring them in quantities of 20. I have found that preparing for
            20 wipes usually does the job. However, the list does not stop here. There are many other consumables that
            can be valuable for unique encounters and for those challenging bosses. Fights like Viscidus, C’Thun, most
            encounters in Naxxramas can all benefit from resistance potions, Flask of the Titans, and stamina food.
            List as follows:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>Flask of the Titans</li>
            <li>Elixir of Fortitude</li>
            <li>Elixir of Greater/Superior Defense</li>
            <li>Major Troll’s Blood Potion</li>
            <li>Greater Nature/Shadow/Frost/Fire Protection Potion</li>
            <li>Crystal Ward</li>
            <li>Monster Omelet (stacks with Dirge’s Kickin’Chimaerock Chops)</li>
            <li>Dirge’s Kickin’Chimaerok Chops
            </li>
            <li>Noggenfogger Elixir</li>
            <li>Magic Resistance Potion</li>
            <li>Swiftness Potion</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Yes, it is a long list but every one of these items can, and will, come in handy on some encounter so I
            suggest you stock up early. Scan the Auction House every day to try and catch consumables at their cheapest
            prices if you cannot farm them yourself… it’s a good money saver and you will need every bent copper for
            Naxxramas.</p>

        <!-- Totems Tab -->
        <div class="tab-pane fade" id="totems">
          <br>
          <h3 class="shaman">Totems</h3>

          <p>*Something you will have to get used to when transitioning from retail is dropping four totems every two
            minutes, or just simply dropping totems at all (lol Legion). Yes, every two minutes! And one for your Mana
            Spring and Healing Stream totems. And say goodbye to Totemic Recall. If you are going to totem pull a
            mob/boss you’ll have to drop a totem of the same element somewhere else or risk looking a fool.</p>

          <p>Totems are integral to the Shaman class (using this logic one may conclude that, in Legion, there are no
            Shaman) and if you fail to drop them you are a bad Shaman (using this logic one may conclude that, in
            Legion, there are no good Shaman). A common mistake many Shaman make is not refreshing their totems as they
            expire or as their party members out-range them. Thirty yards without the talent or 40 yards with the
            talent and T1 3 piece. It is a deceptively small range. I advise you, if you are new to the idea of placing
            buff sticks, to notify your group to spam a macro in party should they notice a totem buff has fallen off.
            It will, of course, be up to you to replace them.</p>

          <p>A second mistake a significant number of Shaman make is not to bind all of their necessary totems. Totem
            binds are a required part of playing the Shaman class. There may be a moment where you have to swap from
            one totem to another rapidly or where there will be no time to open your spell book. Clicking them is not
            an option either. Every time you click a spell a kitten is brutally murdered.</p>

          <p>A final mistake many Shaman make is to neglect the benefit of casting non-melee totems while in a ranged
            DPS or healing group. This is a very serious lapse in judgment as there are several totems that can be
            worthwhile to a ranged DPS or healing party.</p>

          <p>I will run through the list of raid viable totems per element:</p>

          <strong>Earth:</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>Strength of Earth Totem – REQUIRED 100% uptime on this totem when in a melee group. Exception when
              needing Tremor or Earthbind.</li>
            <li>Tremor Totem – An important totem to use when a boss encounter has fear/charm/sleep mechanics.</li>
            <li>Earthbind Totem – A very useful tool in kiting/running from loose trash in an instance.</li>
            <li>Stoneclaw Totem – Good to drop before Earthbind in order to take loose mobs off your tail.</li>
            <li>Stoneskin Totem – Not a very worthwhile totem. Use this if there are, for some reason, two Shaman in a
              melee or tank group.</li>
          </ul>

          <strong>Fire:</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>Frost Resistance Totem – Very beneficial to have down if you are a healer/ranged DPS group during Twin
              Emperors, Sapphiron or other encounters with Frost damage.</li>
            <li>Searing Totem – A nice addition to DPS race boss encounters and useful for snap-aggro on a boss with an
              aggro reset (Skeram, Noth, etc.).</li>
            <li>Fire Nova Totem – A nice addition to nuking adds on encounters such Anub’rhekan and Maexxna.</li>
            <li>Magma Totem – A nice addition to nuking adds/trash if you have the mana.</li>
          </ul>

          <strong>Air:</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>Windfury Totem – REQUIRED 100% uptime while in a melee DPS group. Exception to this rule is when NR/TA
              is required.</li>
            <li>Grace of Air Totem – A nice buff for a group with a Hunter or if you are one of two Shaman in a melee
              DPS group.</li>
            <li>Nature Resistance Totem – Very beneficial for fights involving high amounts of Nature damage. See
              Viscidus and Huhuran.</li>
            <li>Tranquil Air Totem – REQUIRED 100% uptime while in a healing or caster DPS group. Exception when NR is
              required.</li>
            <li>Grounding Totem – Useful for redirecting ranged attacks from susceptible mobs and bosses. Crucial in
              PvP.</li>
          </ul>

          <strong>Water:</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>Mana Spring Totem – REQUIRED 100% uptime. Exception when FR is required.</li>
            <li>Mana Tide Totem – Use on rotation with Dark/Demonic Runes and Mana Potions.</li>
            <li>Poison Cleansing Totem – Mandatory on fights with high poison output (Viscidus, Huhuran, Grand Widow
              Faerlina and some Naxx trash).</li>
            <li>Fire Resistance Totem – Very beneficial for fights involving high amounts of Fire damage.</li>
            <li>Healing Stream Totem – Useful if there are two Shaman in one caster DPS/healer group.</li>
            <li>Disease Cleansing Totem – Nominal usage.</li>
          </ul>
